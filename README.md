# TD-Update-Ego-Postulate

In Temporal Difference Learning - updates to the value function are made by the TD-Error. The ego postulate was proposed by Einstein and says that ego is inversely proportional to knowledge, ego = 1/knowledge. This ego factor is added to the TD-Error to update the value function and as the knowledge of the agent increases, so does the agent's ego.
